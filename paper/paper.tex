  {\bf Rewrite abstract}
  
This paper presents several methods for reducing the I/O
and communication requirements of parallelized boosting.

The inner loop of the tree boosting algorithm is a search for
splitting rules. This search is driven by estimates of expected loss.
 Traditionally, these estimates were based on {\em all
   available data}. Previous work~\cite{} has shown that early
 stopping can be used to reduce the amount of data required.

 In this work we extend the work on early stopping in two ways, both
 of which further increase the speed of the boosting algorithm. First,
 we show how early stopping can be used to parallelize the boosting
 algorithm. Second, we show how memory pressure can be reduced in
 when the examples have non-uniform weights.
 
We describe these improvement and show their mathematical properties.
We implemented our methods for boosting and evaluated them on the
splice-site prediction problem~\cite{sonnenburg_coffin_2010,
  agarwal_reliable_2014}. We compare our performance to that of 
SparkML~\cite{}
XGBoost~\cite{chen_xgboost:_2016},
LightGBM~\cite{ke_lightgbm:_2017}. Our implementation is about ten
times faster than the alternatives (fill in when we have details).
