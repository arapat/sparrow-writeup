% List of affiliations: The first argument should be a (short)

% Academic affiliations should list Department, University, City, Region, Country
% Industry affiliations should list Company, City, Region, Country

% You can specify symbols, otherwise they are numbered in order.
% Ideally, you should not use this facility. Affiliations will be numbered
% in order of appearance and this is the preferred way.

\begin{abstract}
We present a novel approach for parallel computation in the context of
machine learning that we call ``Tell Me Something New'' (\tmsn). This
approach involves a set of independent workers that use broadcast to
update each other when they observe ``something new''. \tmsn\ does not
require synchronization or a head node and is highly resilient against
failing machines or laggards.
We demonstrate the utility \tmsn\ by applying it to learning boosted
trees. We show that our implementation is 10 times faster than
XGBoost~\cite{chen_xgboost:_2016} and LightGBM~\cite{ke_lightgbm:_2017} on the splice-site prediction
problem~\cite{sonnenburg_coffin:_2010, agarwal_reliable_2014}.

% This document was modified from the file originally made available by
% Pat Langley and Andrea Danyluk for ICML-2K. This version was created
% by Iain Murray in 2018. It was modified from a version from Dan Roy in
% 2017, which was based on a version from Lise Getoor and Tobias
% Scheffer, which was slightly modified from the 2010 version by
% Thorsten Joachims & Johannes Fuernkranz, slightly modified from the
% 2009 version by Kiri Wagstaff and Sam Roweis's 2008 version, which is
% slightly modified from Prasad Tadepalli's 2007 version which is a
% lightly changed version of the previous year's version by Andrew
% Moore, which was in turn edited from those of Kristian Kersting and
% Codrina Lauth. Alex Smola contributed to the algorithmic style files.
